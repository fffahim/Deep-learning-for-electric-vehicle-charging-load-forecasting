The forecasting of charging power load for Electric
Vehicles (EVs) has become crucial for ensuring grid stability
and efficiency. In this study, the forecasting capabilities of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM),
and a novel Residual Seq2Seq model are evaluated. Additionally,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to enhance
model performance through dimensionality reduction. The traditional Seq2Seq architecture is extended by the proposed Residual
Seq2Seq model, which incorporates residual connections to better
capture long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this
novel approach in accurately predicting the intricate temporal
patterns inherent in EV charging load data. Furthermore, significant improvements in model accuracy are observed through PCA
analysis when applied to the input data. The Residual Seq2Seq
model, particularly when coupled with PCA-transformed data,
emerges as the top performer, surpassing LSTM and BiLSTM
counterparts. Through comprehensive comparative analysis, the
importance of advanced neural network architectures and dimensionality reduction techniques for precise EV charging load
forecasting is emphasized. These findings highlight implications
for optimizing grid management and facilitating the seamless
integration of electric vehicles into the smart grid infrastructure.
